/**
 * The Transcriber is the one seam the recording lane
 * transcribes through. Both chunk producers (the live RecordingService and the
 * recovery drain) hand every chunk here as 48 kHz Float32 PCM plus the frozen
 * per-recording engine; the seam dispatches to the engine's lane:
 *
 *   cloud → CloudTranscriberLane  (WAV-encode + WorkspaceBackend.uploadTranscriptionChunk)
 *   local → LocalTranscriberLane  (on-device whisper.cpp)
 *   byok  → ByokTranscriberLane   (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
 *
 * The contract mirrors the cloud upload's so the cursor/ack/drain semantics
 * stay untouched: NEVER fails (E = never), resolves a RecordingLaneResult the
 * caller branches on, and yields either [] (silent/empty chunk) or exactly ONE
 * segment per non-empty chunk minted with the server's math (segment.ts) so
 * the store's (recordingId, segmentOrder) upsert identity and the drain's
 * idempotency hold for every engine.
 *
 * Workspace-scoped (sharedWorkspaceServices): one memoized instance provided
 * to BOTH RecordingServiceLive and RecoveryDrainLive, like the RecordingStore.

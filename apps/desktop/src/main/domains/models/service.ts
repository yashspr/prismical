/**
 * The local model manager is boot-scoped device state shared by both modes:
 * downloaded Whisper and VAD weights under
 * AppConfig.modelsDir, mirrored by `local_model` rows in operational.db.
 * Boot-scoped because a multi-GB download must survive a workspace rebuild
 * (org switch / sign-out) and because the weights serve cloud mode too.
 *
 * The observable `state` IS the wire snapshot (catalogue × installed × active
 * downloads); the IPC push fiber re-parses it through the contract schema. The
 * verbs are supervised (one download fiber per model id, interrupted on cancel
 * and on scope close, always leaving no `.part` behind) and their asynchronous
 * outcomes surface through `state`, not through the returned Effect.

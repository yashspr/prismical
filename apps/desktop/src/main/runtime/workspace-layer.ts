/**
 * The workspace layer is the service graph that exists exactly while one workspace
 * is mounted. In cloud mode that is one (account, org) identity — "absent
 * until auth; rebuilt atomically on account/org switch", exactly as before.
 * In local mode it is the accountless on-device workspace: the ProductDb
 * (local.db) plus the LocalBackend serving /apps/v1/me/* from it. Built
 * by runtime/workspace-lifecycle.ts into a per-workspace Scope; the old scope
 * is fully closed before a successor is built.
 *
 * Mode discipline: everything account-free composes in
 * `sharedWorkspaceServices` against the abstract WorkspaceBackend tag —
 * Capture, MicActivity, PermissionService, RecordingService, RecoveryDrain
 * and DetectionService never see SignedInSession or a pinned identity, BY
 * type. Only the backend choice and EventKit (calendar is cloud-only)
 * live in a mode branch.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: refresh machinery (single-flight, scheduler,
 * powerMonitor/focus triggers, restore-on-boot). All of it lives in the
 * boot-scoped AuthService — restart-restore must refresh before any cloud
 * workspace exists. The cloud branch only PINS an identity and borrows tokens
 * through the guard below.

/**
 * The mode-agnostic workspace services are account-free by type — everything

 * WorkspaceBackend and this function never sees a pinned identity. The
 * per-service composition notes are unchanged from the signed-in era:
 *
 * - MicActivity: one detector child and one replay-latest feed per
 *   workspace. Detection and recording consume this same layer instance.
 * - RecordingService: every recording fiber (and its native capture
 *   child) is interrupted and its outbox row parked when the workspace closes
 *   (sign-out / org-switch / quit). It reads the SAME backend the branch
 *   provides, provides its own CaptureLive (needs only MainLogger, from
 *   boot), and shares the boot OperationalDb for the recovery outbox. The
 *   PermissionService gates each start (mic TCC + system-audio ≥14.2
 *   degrade) through the SystemPermissions electron edge; OS-global +
 *   stateless, so mounting it per-workspace is harmless.
 * - RecoveryDrain: forks on acquire, resolving recordings a prior
 *   crash/logout/quit interrupted. Reads the SAME backend + RecordingService
 *   (referenced again → memoized) so it skips the in-flight recording.
 *   Provides no service — merged for its acquire fork.
 * - DetectionService: consumes the shared MicActivity feed (which
 *   owns and reaps the detector child) and the SAME RecordingService to
 *   suppress detection while a recording is active. It NEVER starts a
 *   recording — it publishes DetectionService.state for the widget.
 * - RecordingStore: recording + transcript-segment persistence over
 *   the branch's ProductDb (which is why this block now requires ProductDb).
 *   RecordingService and the drain reference the one const → memoized, so
 *   both write through the SAME store.
 * - Transcriber: the one seam both chunk producers transcribe through,
 *   dispatching per frozen engine to the cloud lane (WAV-encode + the
 *   branch's WorkspaceBackend upload, byte-identical to before), the local
 *   lane (LocalWhisperLive — whisper.cpp through the boot-scoped WhisperEngine,
 *   weights from the boot-scoped ModelManager, vocabulary from the branch's
 *   ProductDb) or the BYOK lane (ByokTranscriberLive — the key from the boot
 *   SecureStore). One const → memoized, so the live path and the drain share
 *   the lanes (and the local lane's per-recording resampler/prompt state).
